## Install nginx
Sure, here are the steps to set up Nginx using Podman and configure it to be accessible from the web:

1. First, ensure that you have installed Podman on your system. You can follow the instructions provided in this [official Podman documentation](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) to install Podman.

2. Next, create a new Podman container for Nginx. You can use the following command to create a new container named `nginx`:

   ```
   sudo podman run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:Z nginx
   ```

   This will start the Nginx container and map port `80` on the host to port `80` in the container. Replace `/path/to/nginx.conf` with the path to your Nginx configuration file.

3. Once you have deployed Nginx, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to make other services accessible from the web. You can refer to this [article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-nginx-multidomain-applications) for more information on how to create a reverse proxy with Nginx and Podman.

   Here is an example Nginx configuration file for GitLab:

   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name gitlab.disquiet-colab.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `gitlab.disquiet-colab.com` with your domain name and `8080` with the port number on which GitLab is running.

4. Test the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

   ```
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

5. Reload the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

That's it! You should now be able to access your services by visiting the appropriate domain name in your web browser. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [official Nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) or the [Podman documentation](https://podman.io/) for more information.

## Install cockpit
Sure, here are the steps to set up Cockpit using Podman and configure it to be accessible from the web:

1. First, ensure that you have installed Podman on your system. You can follow the instructions provided in this [official Podman documentation](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) to install Podman.

2. Next, create a new Podman container for Cockpit. You can use the following command to create a new container named `cockpit`:

   ```
   sudo podman run -d --name cockpit -p 9090:9090 cockpit/ws
   ```

   This will start the Cockpit container and map port `9090` on the host to port `9090` in the container.

3. Once you have deployed Cockpit, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to make it accessible from the web. You can refer to this [article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-nginx-multidomain-applications) for more information on how to create a reverse proxy with Nginx and Podman.

   Here is an example Nginx configuration file for Cockpit:

   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name cockpit.disquiet-colab.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:9090;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `cockpit.disquiet-colab.com` with your domain name.

4. Test the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

   ```
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

5. Reload the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

That's it! You should now be able to access Cockpit by visiting `http://cockpit.disquiet-colab.com` in your web browser. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [official Cockpit documentation](https://cockpit-project.org/) or the [Nginx documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) for more information.

## Install gitlab ce
Here are the steps to set up GitLab Community Edition using Podman and configure it to be accessible from the web:

1. First, ensure that your system meets the prerequisites mentioned in the [official GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html).

2. Next, follow the instructions provided in this [blog post](https://www.ekervhen.xyz/posts/deploying-gitlab-with-podman/) to deploy GitLab with Podman. The post provides a detailed guide on how to prepare the host, configure GitLab, and manage the container lifecycle with systemd.

3. Once you have deployed GitLab, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to make it accessible from the web. You can refer to this [article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-nginx-multidomain-applications) for more information on how to create a reverse proxy with Nginx and Podman.

   Here is an example Nginx configuration file for GitLab:

   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name gitlab.disquiet-colab.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `gitlab.disquiet-colab.com` with your domain name and `8080` with the port number on which GitLab is running.

4. Test the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

   ```
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

5. Reload the Nginx configuration by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

6. Finally, start the GitLab container using Podman by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo podman run -d --name gitlab -p 8080:80 gitlab/gitlab-ce
   ```

   This will start the GitLab container and map port `8080` on the host to port `80` in the container.

That's it! You should now be able to access GitLab by visiting `http://gitlab.disquiet-colab.com` in your web browser. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [official GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html) or the [Nginx documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) for more information.
